**Iteration 3 Approach Without a Predefined Interaction Pattern**

In the absence of a defined interaction pattern for Iteration 3, our team focused on achieving a comprehensive understanding of the project's requirements. We utilized the functional checklist provided at the bottom of the project page as a guiding tool to ensure that our design decisions were aligned with the expected functionality. This iterative approach involved conducting thorough research, creating prototypes, and continuously refining our work to produce a user-friendly and effective solution.

**Considerations for Additional Development Time**

If given an additional day to work on the project, we would have aimed to implement more advanced features, such as enabling users to create custom ships. However, considering the anticipated time investment and our commitment to maintaining project stability, we chose to prioritize the completion and robustness of core functionality. Additionally, we envisioned enhancing the computer player's AI to offer a more dynamic experience. This enhancement would involve developing a more sophisticated strategy, empowering the computer player to make smarter decisions and thereby providing a greater challenge to users. We also allocated time for peer code reviews, addressing any feedback received, and preparing for overall project evaluation.

**Pairing Techniques Utilized**

Our team employed a highly collaborative and flexible pairing approach throughout the project. We adopted a modified ping-pong pairing technique, engaging in frequent discussions to plan and prioritize our tasks effectively. Additionally, we incorporated elements of pair programming to tackle challenging problems and ensure high code quality. In scenarios where one team member could not participate, the other would take on a larger task and subsequently create a pull request for review and integration once the absent member returned. This strategy promoted a balanced workload and fostered knowledge sharing within the team.

**Feedback Mechanisms During the Project**

Feedback was primarily shared through code reviews, facilitated by the use of pull requests. This process allowed for an in-depth examination of code changes, identification of potential issues, and constructive discussions regarding improvements. Furthermore, we utilized code comments to provide quick references, clarify specific aspects of our work, and offer general guidance to one another, enhancing our collaborative effort throughout the project.
