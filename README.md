# Battleship - Paired Project Repository

## Donte Handy and Jaren Garman

Q:Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem solving process.   

A: In the absence of a predefined interaction pattern for Iteration 3, we prioritized a thorough understanding of the project's requirements. We utilized the functional checklist at the bottom of the page as a guide, ensuring that our design decisions aligned with the expected functionality. This iterative process involved research, prototyping, and constant refinement to achieve a user-friendly and effective solution.   

Q: If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

A: With an additional day, we would have explored the implementation of a more advanced feature, such as allowing users to create custom ships. However, due to the anticipated time commitment and the desire to maintain project stability, we prioritized completing the core functionality and ensuring its robustness. We also would have liked to implement a more sophisticated AI for the computer player, as the current version is relatively simple and predictable. This would have involved developing a more advanced strategy for the computer player to make more intelligent decisions and provide a more challenging experience for the user. We also left time to prepare for peer code reviews and address any feedback received and prepare for evaluation.

Q: Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

A: Our pairing approach was highly collaborative and flexible. We adopted a modified ping-pong pairing approach, engaging in frequent discussions to plan and prioritize tasks. We also incorporated elements of pair programming, working together to solve challenging problems and ensure code quality. In instances where one team member was unable to work, the other would complete a larger task and create a pull request for their partner to review and integrate upon returning. This approach ensured a balanced workload and knowledge sharing.

Q: Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

A: Feedback was primarily exchanged during code reviews facilitated by pull requests. This allowed for thorough examination of code changes, identification of potential issues, and constructive discussions. We also utilized code comments to provide quick references, clarify specific aspects of the work, and offer general guidance to each other.
