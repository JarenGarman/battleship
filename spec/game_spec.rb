# Explanation
# Initialization: Tests that the Game class initializes with game_over set to false.
# Start Game: Tests that the start_game method calls setup_game, play_game, and end_game.
# Setup Game: Tests that the setup_game method sets up ships for both the player and the computer.
# Play Game: Tests that the play_game method alternates turns between the player and the computer until the game is over.
# Check Game Over: Tests that the check_game_over method correctly sets the game over state and displays the appropriate message when all ships are sunk.
